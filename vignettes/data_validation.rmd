In order to calculate the buy and hold return we take the first and last price

```{r}

temp_bhar = price_df %>% 
  filter(id == "1062_1098755") %>% 
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(date - min(date))) %>% 
  filter(duration <= 251 * 3) %>% 
  arrange(duration) %>% 
  select(date, duration, contains("price")) %>% 
  slice(1, length(duration)) %>% 
  summarise(bhar_ipo = price_ipo[2] / price_ipo[1] - 1,
            bhar_control = price_control[2] / price_control[1] - 1,
            bhar_abnormal = bhar_ipo - bhar_control,
            duration = duration[2], .groups = "drop")

all.equal(temp_bhar,bhar_3 %>% 
            filter(id == "1062_1098755") %>% 
            select(-contains("id")))
