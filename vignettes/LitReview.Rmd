@KashefiPour2013 study the going private transactions (voluntary delistings) that took place in London AIM stock exchange during 1995- 2009 period. They find the delisting firms come more leveraged to the IPO relative to size and IPO matched non delisting firms. The firms remain highly leveraged with low profitability and low liquidity during their market life. During their market life the firm's market value and trading volume decrease while it's leverage and insider ownership increases. The authors conclude that those firmas came to the market to rebalance their capital structure but having fail to raise additional capital were taken private. The leverage seems to be the most important factor in the delisting decision. The authors also document negative returns prior to the delisting event. As for the methodology the authors employ logit regression for the test and control groups in order to identify the delisting decision factors. They also perform an event study to evaluate the markets reaction to delisting.
