Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) represent a crucial stage in a company's life cycle, providing opportunities for growth, capital raising, and increased visibility. However, extensive research has drawn attention to the phenomenon of long-term underperformance observed in IPOs, raising concerns about the allocation of capital and market efficiency. IPO underperformance refers to the tendency of newly listed companies to exhibit poor long-term stock performance compared to non-IPO firms. This underperformance challenges the belief that IPOs offer reliable avenues for generating superior returns.

The persistent underperformance of IPOs raises questions about the efficient allocation of capital in the market. If IPOs consistently exhibit long-term underperformance, it suggests that capital may be misallocated to firms with lower prospects or inflated valuations. Inefficient allocation of capital not only results in losses for IPO investors but also hampers economic growth and productivity as resources are directed away from more deserving and productive investments.

Moreover, the presence of IPO underperformance has broader implications for market efficiency. Efficient markets are expected to incorporate all available information and efficiently price securities based on their intrinsic value. However, the observed underperformance in IPOs indicates that markets may fail to accurately assess the true value of newly listed companies. Information asymmetry, agency problems, and behavioral biases may contribute to the mispricing and subsequent underperformance of IPOs, casting doubts on the efficiency of the IPO market.

The existing literature on IPO long-run underperformance has yielded mixed evidence, leading to an inconclusive understanding of this phenomenon. While some studies have reported significant underperformance of IPOs compared to non-IPO firms over extended periods, others have found no significant difference or even evidence of outperformance. This lack of consensus highlights the need for further investigation and this study aims to provide valuable insights and contribute to the ongoing discussion, ultimately advancing our understanding of IPO performance in the long run.
